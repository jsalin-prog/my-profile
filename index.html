        <p>
            My name is Julie Salin, I'm 19 years old and I am a student at ESSEC Business School where I study business and mangement, the courses are taught entirely in English. 
            I am currently living in Cergy, but I used to live in Bordeaux with my family. I am a very cheerful, smiling and loyal person.
            My friends and my family are the most important things in my life.

        <h2>‚ù§Ô∏è FRIENDS & FAMILY ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>
            I am fond of my friends and my family. They are very important to me and they are the main source of my happiness. 
            I therefore really enjoy spending time in Bordeaux in order to see my family, with whom I love sharing good moments, especially when the entire family gathers for specific events (weddings, vacations, etc.).
            I also love hanging out with my friends and I have the chance to have met incredible people in my new school. 
            At ESSEC, I have a group of six bestfriends that have become a huge part of my life. I also do my best to keep in touch with my friends in Bordeaux who have been there for more than ten years.

        <h2>‚úàÔ∏è TRAVELS ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
            Travelling is one of my passion, I intend to travel around the world later in my life.
            I was born in Martinique where I lived for five years.
            In high school, I have had the opportunity to go to Australia during two weeks and it was one of the best experiences of my life.
            At ESSEC, I will be able to study a semester abroad. I have been selected to go to Africa, and particularly in Rabat.

        <h2>üèÜSPORTS üèÜ</h2>
        <p>
            I really like doing sports, I've been doing physical activities my whole life. I took ballet class during six years, I played tennis during two years and I did gymnastics during five years, which was my passion.
            Unfortunately, because of a medical problem I was no longer able to do gymnastics. I am now part of the ESSEC cheerleading team with my friends and I have so much fun doing this sport.
